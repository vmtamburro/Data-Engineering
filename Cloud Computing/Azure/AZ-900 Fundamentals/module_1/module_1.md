## Cloud Computing Fundamentals

### What is Cloud Computing?
Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services—such as servers, storage, databases, networking, software, and analytics—over the internet. It enables faster innovation, flexible resources, and economies of scale.

### Benefits of Cloud Computing
- **Cost Efficiency:** Pay only for what you use, reducing upfront costs.
- **Scalability:** Adjust resources dynamically to meet demand.
- **High Availability:** Resources are accessible when needed, supported by SLAs.
- **Global Reach:** Access resources from anywhere in the world.
- **Security:** Built-in security features and compliance with regulations.

### High Availability
High availability ensures that resources and services are accessible whenever needed. Azure provides SLAs to guarantee uptime and availability.

### Scalability vs Elasticity
- **Scalability:** The ability to increase or decrease resources to meet demand.
  - **Vertical Scaling:** Increasing or decreasing the capabilities of a resource (e.g., upgrading a VM).
  - **Horizontal Scaling:** Adding or removing resources (e.g., adding more VMs).
- **Elasticity:** The ability to automatically scale resources up or down based on demand.

### Reliability & Predictability
- **Reliability:** The ability of a system to recover from failures and continue functioning.
- **Predictability:**
  - **Performance Predictability:** Features like autoscaling and load balancing ensure consistent performance.
  - **Cost Predictability:** Tools like the Azure Pricing Calculator help manage costs.

### Security & Governance Benefits
- **Security:** Azure provides built-in security features, including protection against DDoS attacks.
- **Governance:** Azure enables organizations to enforce compliance with corporate and regulatory standards through policies and templates.

### Manageability in the Cloud
- **Management of the Cloud:** Automate scaling, deploy resources using templates, monitor health, and receive alerts.
- **Management in the Cloud:** Manage resources via the Azure Portal, CLI, APIs, or PowerShell.

### Capital Expenditure (CapEx)
CapEx refers to upfront investments in physical infrastructure, such as servers and data centers.

### Operational Expenditure (OpEx)
OpEx refers to ongoing costs for services and products. Cloud computing operates under an OpEx model, where you pay for what you use.

### Consumption-Based Model
The consumption-based model allows you to pay only for the resources you consume. This model helps optimize costs and scale resources as needed.

### Knowledge Check
- What are the key benefits of cloud computing?
- How does elasticity differ from scalability?
- What is the difference between CapEx and OpEx?

## Cloud Service Models

### Cloud Service Models Overview
Cloud service models define the level of control and responsibility between the cloud provider and the consumer. The three primary models are Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Software as a Service (SaaS).

### Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)
- **Definition:** Provides virtualized computing resources over the internet.
- **Responsibilities:**
  - **Provider:** Manages hardware, networking, and physical security.
  - **Consumer:** Manages operating systems, applications, and data.
- **Use Cases:**
  - Lift-and-shift migrations
  - Testing and development environments
  - Hosting websites and applications

### Platform as a Service (PaaS)
- **Definition:** Provides a platform allowing consumers to develop, run, and manage applications without managing the underlying infrastructure.
- **Responsibilities:**
  - **Provider:** Manages infrastructure, operating systems, middleware, and development tools.
  - **Consumer:** Focuses on application development and data.
- **Use Cases:**
  - Application development and deployment
  - Business intelligence and analytics
  - Streamlining development workflows

### Software as a Service (SaaS)
- **Definition:** Delivers fully managed applications over the internet.
- **Responsibilities:**
  - **Provider:** Manages everything, including the application.
  - **Consumer:** Uses the application without worrying about maintenance.
- **Use Cases:**
  - Email and collaboration tools (e.g., Microsoft 365)
  - Customer relationship management (CRM) software
  - Finance and expense tracking applications

### Shared Responsibility Model
The shared responsibility model defines the division of responsibilities between the cloud provider and the consumer. Responsibilities vary depending on the service model:
- **IaaS:** Consumer has the most control.
- **PaaS:** Responsibilities are shared.
- **SaaS:** Provider has the most control.

### Service Model Comparison Table
| Feature                | IaaS            | PaaS            | SaaS            |
|------------------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Consumer Responsibility| Most            | Moderate        | Least           |
| Provider Responsibility| Least           | Moderate        | Most            |
| Use Cases              | Hosting, Testing| Development     | Productivity    |

### Exam Tip: Identifying Service Models
- **IaaS:** Think of renting virtual hardware.
- **PaaS:** Think of a platform for developers.
- **SaaS:** Think of ready-to-use applications.

### Knowledge Check
- What are the key differences between IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS?
- Who is responsible for managing the operating system in PaaS?
- Provide an example use case for each service model.
