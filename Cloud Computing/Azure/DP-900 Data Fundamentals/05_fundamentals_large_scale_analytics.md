## [Introduction](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/examine-components-of-modern-data-warehouse/1-introduction)
- Large-Scale Data Analytics solutions combine conventional data warehousing and data lakehouse techniques to integrate data from files and external sources
- A conventional data warehouse solution typically involves copying data from transactional data stores into a relational db with a schema that's optimized for queryigna nd building multidimensional models
- Data lakehouse solutions on the other hand, are used with large volumes of data in multiple formats, which is batch loaded or captured in real-time streams and stored in a data lake from which distributed processing engines like Apache Spark are used to process it.
