* Model collections of entities from the real world as tables
* An entity can be anything for which you want to record information -typically important objects and events
* Tables contain rows, and each row represents a single instance of that entity
* Relational tables are a format for structured data and each row in a table has the same columns; through in some cases, not all columns need to have a value
* Each column stores data of a specific data type
* Available datatypes that you can use when defining a table depend on the system you are using. 
* Standard datatypes are defined by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI)  that are supported by most database systems.
